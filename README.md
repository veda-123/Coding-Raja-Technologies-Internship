This repository contains two web applications: a Resume Builder and a Music Player.

Resume Builder
The Resume Builder is a web application designed to simplify the process of creating professional resumes. Users can input their personal information, education, work experience, skills, and more into a user-friendly form. The application dynamically generates a preview of the resume based on the entered details, allowing users to see how their resume will look in real-time. Additionally, users can choose from multiple resume templates to find the one that best suits their needs. Once satisfied with the resume, users can download it in either PDF or Word format.

Music Player
The Music Player is a simple web-based application for playing audio tracks. It allows users to create playlists, add tracks to the playlist, and control playback using standard audio controls such as play/pause, next, previous, shuffle, and repeat. The application supports various audio formats and provides a visually appealing interface for an enhanced user experience.
